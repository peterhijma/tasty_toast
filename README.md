# tasty_toast

A simple package which shows a toast at the top, center or bottom (default) of the screen.
I've created this package because I was looking for something similar, but didn't like how other packages handled my (simple) usecase.

You can easily customize the toast by providing a `TextStyle` for the text or `BoxDecoration` for the background.

## Getting Started

Add this package.

```
Toast.show(
context,
"Time entry saved successfully! Time entry saved successfully! Time entry saved
```
